# NumpyNeuralNetwork

This was Unviersity Coursework that has been preovously submitted and shows my learning as obviously much fo this can be improved.
These tasks were designed to help us understand how neural networks work.

 - Task 2 is the numpy neural network used to evlauate images from the MNIST hadn written digits dataset. 
 - The results of one of the network and variable setups that provided good results can be seen below:

 - Task 3 is the same thing however the network was made using Pytorch so can be used as a comparison. 
 - The results of one of the network and variable setups that provided good results can be seen below (the setup is the same as for task 2 for comparison):
